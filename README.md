# 🐍 PyRunner

A lightweight, Python-powered shell-like interface for entering and executing Python code interactively, powered by [rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich).

## 🚀 Features

- Interactive prompt for entering multi-line Python code
- Executes Python code interactively (multi-line supported)
- If input is not valid Python, attempts to run it as a shell command
- Shell commands are executed in a zsh environment with your `.zshrc` sourced (aliases and functions work)
- Syntax-highlighted output and prompts via rich
- Handles keyboard interrupts gracefully
